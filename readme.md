## Demo

Here is a live [SAMS & RAMS site](https://sms.bicpu.edu.in ':target=_blank') by SAMS TEAM - Pondicherry university-PUSAMS [source code](https://github.com/bicpu/sams.git ':target=_blank').



## Why SAMS ?

The software SAMS is an online-platform that is meant to manage entire gambit of CBCS – from [ Student Details, registration of courses, approval of registration by the faculty, allocation of courses to the faculty, conduct of classes, online fee payments, student attendance, internal assessment, end-semester assessment, conversion of marks to grades, declaration of results, grade card generation & distribution, No-dues clearance, verification of Course Completion, Consolidated Mark sheet, Provisional Certificate, Degree Generation and all reports]. The software works on the principle of differential access and need-to-know basis.

## What can be done using SAMS?

PU-SAMS is a unique ‘eGov’ solution

Student Academics, based on “Choice

allows students to choose their subjects. PU-SAMS helps the Students,
