# CORS

All services allow for very permissive [CORS](https://enable-cors.org) (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).

This means that you can invoke your services from any origin, though we recommend against calling your services from client-side JavaScript code on the web due to the the private nature of your auth tokens.
