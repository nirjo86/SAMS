# Mission

> **Our mission is to provide sustainable funding for open source.**

If you've ever struggled to make a living working on open source, we hear you.

OSS can be extremely powerful and rewarding, but there is a huge problem that exists in the market between how valuable open source is to every business in existence versus how difficult it is for OSS developers to capture any of that value.

Donation platforms like Patreon and GitHub Sponsors help with a very small percentage of this problem because the business model of voluntarily giving back to OSS is inherently weak.

Contrast this with the standard SaaS API business model of paying based on usage that aligns much more naturally with how businesses actually pay for software critical to their core business needs.

Saasify is aiming to bridge the gap between this disparity by reducing the barrier to entry for developers who are interested in earning passive income via SaaS.

## OSS Community

While it is our sincere hope that Saasify will help with the problem of OSS sustainability, we're aware that there is likely no silver bullet solution that will work for everyone when faced with such a complex problem. Towards that end, we hope to work with others in the OSS community who have similar goals and motivations to make sustainable OSS funding a reality.

If you're an OSS author who's struggled to find balance or has needed to find a day job to sustain your OSS work, we'd love to hear from you! Please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:info@saasify.sh) && thanks!
